"""
The present data structure of svariables is:
{'field_name': ("field_value","data_type")}

The proposed data structure of svariables will be:
{'field_name': ("field_value","data_type",["field_property"],[SasMol]} (Note, [] means optional)

The "field_property" can be null suggesting a pass for the following check:
"""

function input_filter_check_file_type_and_dir_permission(svariables):

  Loop over svariables:

    Get its "field_property" and "field_value";
    Pass if "field_property" is null;
    Otherwise:

      Check whether the file or directory of "field_value" exist;
      Return error if the file or directory doesn't exist;
      Otherwise:

        If "field_property" is a "pdb":
          Do a quick pdb-type check by reading 1 frame (sasio.read_pdb(...,fastread,...));
          Save the readed SasMol object to "SasMol" in the svariables dictionary

        If "field_property" is a "dcd":
          Do a quick dcd-type check by reading its header (sasio.open_dcd_read);

        If "field_property" is a "psf":
          Do a quick psf-type check by reading its header;

        If "field_property" is a "exe":
          Check whether the file is an executable binary;

        If "field_property" is a "path":
          Check whether we have the r/w permission for the directory;

        If ...

        Return error or no-error depending on the check results;
