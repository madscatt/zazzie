## Requires

nbstripout
`pip install nbstripout`

Do not use git kracken when commiting .ipynb files as it doesn't seem to run the proper nbstripout command.
Rather you should commit from the command line.

# Data Files
Are located on Ian's computer and should be placed in `/home/data/sascaclc_pbc`

To grab them:
`rsync -avuzC user@129.6.121.112:/home/data/sascalc_pbc /home/data/.`

`GV.py`:  cp from golden vector code (unmodified)
